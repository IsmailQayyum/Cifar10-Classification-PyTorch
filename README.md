# Cifar10-Classification-PyTorch
In this notebook , I have developed a custom convolutional neural architecture to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different categories (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird, etc.). Through constant experimentation and embedding different techniques , I have reached an accuracy of 81%.
